# mElite
Elite Clone.

mElite is a computer game based on the seminal 1984 game Elite by David Braben and Ian Bell. The game was developed as a project connected to the course Grafica al Calcolatore (Computer Graphics) at Universit√° degli Studi di Verona held by Andrea Fusiello. The game was developed by Jan-Philipp Kappmeier (at TU Berlin) and Melanie Schmidt (at TU Dortmund) within three months from December 2006 to February 2007. With exception of the C core part that was given, the game is completely written in C++.
