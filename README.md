# mElite
Elite Clone.

mElite is a computer game based on the seminal 1984 game Elite by David Braben and Ian Bell. The game was developed as a project connected to the course [Grafica al Calcolatore (Computer Graphics)](http://web.archive.org/web/20070615082755/http://profs.sci.univr.it:80/~fusiello/teaching/grafica/)<sup>[1](#footnote_archive)</sup> ([official course description](http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=oi&aa=2006%2F2007&codiceCs=S04&codins=10554&cs=187&discr=&discrCd=)) at Universitá degli Studi di Verona held by [Andrea Fusiello](http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=2) (now at [Universitá di Udine](http://www.diegm.uniud.it/fusiello/index.php/About_me)). The game was developed by Jan-Philipp Kappmeier (now at [TomTom](https://tomtom.com)) and Melanie Schmidt (now at [University of Cologne](https://ag-schmidt.cs.uni-koeln.de/index)) within three months from December 2006 to February 2007. With exception of the C core part that was given, the game is completely written in C++.
